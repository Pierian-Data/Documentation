<p>
To cancel an order, you must use its $[OrderTicket, T:QuantConnect.Orders.OrderTicket]. Market Orders are transmitted to the brokerage immediately and cannot be canceled. The <code>Cancel()</code> method returns an $[OrderResponse, T:QuantConnect.Orders.OrderResponse] object to determine if the operation was successful.

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">// Create an order and save its ticket
var ticket = LimitOrder("SPY", 100, 221.05, tag: "SPY Trade to Cancel");

//Later cancel the order via the order ticket.
var response = ticket.Cancel();

// Use order response object to read status
if (response.IsSuccess) {
       Debug("Order successfully canceled");
}
